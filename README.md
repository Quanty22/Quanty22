Novel Encryption System Incorporating Multifactorial Key and High-Entropy Data Archiving
Introduction
The operating principle of our encryption system differs significantly from existing systems. We introduce a multifactorial key, blurring the line between password and key. By allowing the user to choose the parameters, the system achieves a high level of security. This paper explores the concept of a multifactorial key within our ecosystem, discussing its nature and user-defined characteristics.
Computational Efficiency
To optimize the encryption process, we carefully select the fastest processor commands available. These commands enhance the numerical complexity of the ecosystem, resulting in a high level of entropy. Reversible and irreversible functions are employed, manipulating arrays in order to generate high entropy. This computational efficiency greatly increases the encryption speed and overall computational density. The computational density is calculated by dividing the number of operations performed by the product of time and data volume. Our system's computational density demonstrates an absolute advantage over traditional encryption systems.
NaVeOl Data Conversion
Conventional computer systems primarily operate using binary numbers, a base-2 system with digits represented as multiples of one byte. However, this reliance on binary systems poses a security risk. We introduce the NaVeOl data conversion method, which utilizes number systems that are not multiples of one byte. By utilizing non-binary number systems, we enhance the complexity and diversify the data protection systems employed within our ecosystem. NaVeOl presents a unique approach to data conversion, ensuring an additional layer of security.
Novel Ecosystem Paradigm
Our technology treats the ecosystem as an independent entity, regardless of the specific data being encrypted. This novel paradigm allows for a comprehensive approach to encryption, focusing on the system as a whole. By considering the ecosystem as an object with distinct characteristics, we enhance the overall security and effectiveness of the encryption process.
Data integration into the ecosystem is a fundamental step towards creating a custom file system. The security of the integrated data depends on the complexity of the ecosystem and is limited only by the computational capabilities of modern computers. The ability to replace one ecosystem with another provides a means to increase the cryptographic strength of data. This concept holds true even in the context of quantum computing. In this paper, we explore the integration of data into the ecosystem and its impact on security.
Computational Density and Encryption Strength

To illustrate the relationship between computational density and encryption strength, let's consider encoding a 1-byte data (D) within a time of 1 second (T) using a single processor operation (O). The computational density (CP) is calculated as 

If we perform one operation per second (O=1), the computational density is 

CP = 1.
By increasing the number of operations to O=10, we can encode 10 bytes per second, resulting in 
CP = 100.
Further reducing the time to 0.1 seconds while encoding only 0.5 bytes (D=0.5), CP increases to
CP = 200.
Higher computational density (CP) allows for a greater number of changes to be made, thereby making the information more confusing. Conversely, lower computational density facilitates the selection of decoding algorithms due to the limited number of changes that have occurred.
Enhanced Security through Data Integration
Integrating data into the ecosystem enhances security by leveraging the inherent complexity of the ecosystem. The computational density parameter allows for fine-tuning the level of encryption strength based on the data volume, time, and number of operations. By manipulating these parameters, the confusion within the data increases, making it more challenging to decipher the information.
Adaptability to Quantum Computing
The integration of data into the ecosystem provides flexibility in adapting to future technological advancements, such as quantum computing. In the event that stronger cryptographic measures are required, replacing the existing ecosystem with a new one can be a viable solution.
In our system, binary encryption is the main differentiating factor. While other systems aim to create high entropy through entanglement, our approach involves further chaos manipulation using two encryption systems and a multifactorial key. Each unique table of 256 bytes can be transformed based on the current multi-factorial key. Encryption is just a small part of our system, as we have also devised a method to generate data digitally, eliminating the need for additional methods to restore order from chaos. This paper explores the concept of binary encryption and its complex nature compared to current encryption systems like AES 256.
Connectivity and Key Selection
Our system operates in n-dimensional space, allowing us to connect all eco-files of the keys through their checksums, ranging in size from one byte to 2 GB. The process of choosing such a key and understanding its properties is a crucial aspect that we explore extensively.
Password length and mathematical universe of the key 
We have set the minimum password length to eight characters, but the maximum length is not limited. The second factor is the eco-file (key), which the user chooses independently, making it significantly harder to recognize. Some versions include additional factors, such as the program's serial number, and so on. Based on this data, a multifactor key is formed. We call it DNA because it is the basis of the ecosystem. The DNA in our mathematical universe uses combinatorics from 256 to the 256th power, with a minimum multifactor key length of 4092 bits. Data archiving with high entropy Our approach to data archiving includes evenly distributed byte blocks in a 256-byte array.

In light of the ongoing global political discourse regarding encryption, coupled with evolving worldwide regulations that pertain to encryption accessibility, including discussions about the introduction of backdoors, as well as the imposition of limitations on public encryption access in various countries, encryption providers today face substantial challenges in adhering to both global and local laws while offering encryption platforms.

The list of countries imposing software/hardware import and export restrictions on other nations is constantly expanding and changing. In this context, 8(to)7, as a Dutch entity, is committed to upholding Dutch regulations and laws.
