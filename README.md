- 👋 Hi, We are 8(to)7
- 👀 We are  interested in post-quantum Quantum Encryptions worldwide
- 🌱 We currently deploying our code and being tested in multiple Industries segments.
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate on quantum encryption with companies worldwide.
- 📫 How to reach us... quanty22@eighttoseven.com
Our encryption can be used not only for data but also for transmissions.
Reduce data storage, reduce transmission time, and be quantum-resistant!
Check out our source code and find out for yourself the many advantages 8(to)7 has compared to, for example:
 AES256 and Homomorphic encryption
