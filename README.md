- 👋 Hi, We are 8(to)7
- https://eighttoseven.com/
- 👀 We are  interested in post-quantum Quantum Encryptions worldwide
- 🌱 We currently deploying our code and being tested in multiple Industries segments.
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate on quantum encryption with companies worldwide.
- 📫 How to reach us... quanty22@eighttoseven.com
Our encryption can be used not only for data but also for transmissions.
Reduce data storage, reduce transmission time, and be quantum-resistant!
Check out our source code and find out for yourself the many advantages 8(to)7 has compared to, for example:
 AES256 and Homomorphic encryption

In light of the ongoing global political discourse regarding encryption, coupled with evolving worldwide regulations that pertain to encryption accessibility, including discussions about the introduction of backdoors, as well as the imposition of limitations on public encryption access in various countries, encryption providers today face substantial challenges in adhering to both global and local laws while offering encryption platforms.

The list of countries imposing software/hardware import and export restrictions on other nations is constantly expanding and changing. In this context, 8(to)7, as a Dutch entity, is committed to upholding Dutch regulations and laws.

At 8(to)7, we are staunch advocates of open-source software. To this end, we have established an organizational page where, upon a simple request, you will be promptly granted unrestricted access to our source code.

The 8(to)7 team remains dedicated to the mission !Encryption is a right for everybody!

You can easily access our source codes by becoming a member of our organization page by providing: GitHub account or  Email address
